//! The `janus` CLI (plan task 5.5): `verify`, `explain`, `upgrade` and `component`, over the *same
//! engine* every SDK will speak to.
//!
//! Nothing here reaches into the kernel's Rust API to do its work. Each command builds protocol
//! frames and reads frames back ([`engine`]), which is what makes this CLI evidence rather than a
//! convenience: if a command needs something the protocol cannot express, that is a finding about
//! the protocol and it shows up here first. `janus-engine`, the sibling binary, carries the
//! identical frames over stdio for embeddings that want a subprocess (ADR 0023: every SDK's).
//!
//! `component` (plan task 8.2) is the one command that does not speak the protocol, and says why
//! in its own module: publishing a component is not an engine operation.
//!
//! `check` (plan task 7.4) is the one command whose subject is not a provider but a *decision*:
//! it reads documents that already exist — contracts, provider shapes, the summaries `verify`
//! wrote — and answers the RFC's `can-i-deploy` question over them. Same rule as the rest: the
//! walk, the policy and the page all live behind `subsumption/check` and `subsumption/decide`
//! (engine-protocol spec §8.6), because a broker or a GitHub Action asking the same question has
//! to get the same answer.

const USAGE: &str = "\
usage: janus <command> [options]

  verify    replay a contract or a v1-v4 pact at a running provider
  check     decide whether a consumer can deploy against a provider
  explain   print the plan the engine will execute for one interaction
  upgrade   convert a v1-v4 pact into a Janus contract
  component push a WASM component to an OCI registry, or pull one and say what it is
  version   print the engine and protocol versions

`janus <command> --help` explains one of them.

Every command speaks the engine protocol to the same engine an SDK embeds — set
RUST_LOG=debug to watch it.";
