# The SDK is released, and fetches the engine it was released with

The SDK is released as files on a GitHub release of its own: `pact-janus-<version>.tgz`, installed by
its URL, or the JVM SDK's `io.pact.janus:janus-sdk` and `janus-bindings` jars, read by Gradle through
an `ivy` repository (ADR 0060). The JVM modules were `io.pact.janus:sdk` and `io.pact.janus:bindings`.

Told no engine to run, the SDK runs the `janus-engine` release it pins. It fetches the engine on
first use into `JANUS_ENGINE_CACHE`, or by default `pact-janus/engines` in the user's cache directory.
It fetches from `JANUS_ENGINE_MIRROR` when that is set, and refuses any file whose SHA-256 is not the
pinned one. `JANUS_ENGINE` still names another engine. The SDK no longer runs a `janus-engine` from
the `PATH`; name it in `JANUS_ENGINE` instead.

The engine it pins is janus-engine 0.4.2, the first release with everything the SDK asks of it: the
v4 `statusCode` matcher, and message producers served from the test.
